Hey guys,
I am in high school right now. I am currently learning Java and am passionate about this. I have wanted to make programming and software development as a career. What things do you recommend I and other eager high schoolers do in high school that you feel will be beneficial when we go to college or skip college and go straight into the work force. Any recommendations on languages to learn/how much networking should be done/ should we reach out to companies and programming bootcamps to slowly build relations and how deep should we go with each language so that we are in great shape by the end of high school. Any tips at all would be great! thanks
