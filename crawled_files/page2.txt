I really enjoy programming but i program in my room and eventually get distracted with videos, games, etc. 
I'm looking for a way to program productively and thus my question to everyone is what environment do you guys like to program in? Not IDEs but the environment in which you situate yourself in to have a pleasant time programming.

Lounge Room?
Specific Music?
Outside?
Time of the day? 
With food/drinks?
After a session of gaming/movie? 
Other 

Of course it's subjective but all suggestions will be appreciated!
Cheers,
