I have these 2 friends work on making video games for phones. well i asked them if i could work there after I learn programing
They sold me a software called RPG Maker VX Ace, first off.. I know I got ripped off because I checked the website and it costs $59.99 there but I got it off them for $120. 
Now second thing is I did ask others and it seems this is not what programmers are using.
