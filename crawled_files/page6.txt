Hello there,
I'm just a beginner at programming, but my question is simple..
I want to create a software that makes me create and keep track of the characters I made, I'm writing a story and I have to keep track of them..
So, I'm thinking of a software that has a "Main form" with button that transfers you to other "Characters Forms" and things like that, I already know how to make all of this in Visual Studio, But the question is, I want to make new entries and characters as a User of that software, not as the Creator of it, is that possible ?
To make things more clear I want something like this :

READ THIS: All what I need is :
1-Is this possible to make ?
2-what software can I use to create this ?
Thank you all.
